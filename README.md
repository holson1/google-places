About
-------------  
  

My Google Places App allows users to search for places anywhere across the world! For example, try typing in "pizza in portland" and hit Enter. You will see the map populate with markers, and information about your results will display to the right. Try clicking on both!

> **Features:**

> - Fully responsive design. Try in mobile view to see a tailored user experience
> - Scrollable result panels section
> - Click on a marker to bring up the place's name and auto-scroll to its matching result panel
> - Click on a result panel to pan the map to a marker
> - Warning text when no search is entered
